Remote Procedure Calls
We know how to call local methods using any language. that is very simple to invoke that method to your working class. but, if we want to call another method run in another environment, then how do we call to that program. we want a protocol to communicate, which means we want a standard way to use all of the users. So, we can introduce remote procedure calls as a protocol.Â 
Our purpose is to just call the remote methods and get responses quickly. We don't want to understand network details like where to run. So, the RPC protocol is good for that. It uses a message-based communication schema as a separate environment. As well as, in here, It use well-structured packet data.
